excerpt: 'The study aimed to identify different molds that grow on various food surfaces. As a result, we conducted a case
study for the detection of mold on food surfaces based on the “you only look once (YOLO) v5” principle. In this
context, a dataset of 2050 food images with mold growing on their surfaces was created. Images were obtained
from our own laboratory (850 images) as well as from the internet (1200 images). The dataset was trained using
the pre-trained YOLOv5 algorithm. A laboratory test was also performed to confirm that the grown organisms
were mold. In comparison to YOLOv3 and YOLOv4, this current YOLOv5 model had better precision, recall, and
average precision (AP), which were 98.10%, 100%, and 99.60%, respectively. The YOLOv5 algorithm was used
for the first time in this study to detect mold on food surfaces. In conclusion, the proposed model successfully
recognizes any kind of mold present on the food surface. Using YOLOv5, we are currently conducting research to
identify the specific species of the detected mold.'
